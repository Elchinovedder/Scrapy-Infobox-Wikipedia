# Scrapy-Infobox-Wikipedia
first project in scrapy for wikipedia infoboxes

Hi all this is my first project in scrapy and github so hi to all again!. As i said this is the first of many projects i guess so if you
see something very dummy it because im new to this. So im sorry. The idea of this project (and hope somebody tell me how to improbe this it will
be awesome), is scrape infoboxes from wikipedia. I have several brain damages reading about scrapy and python but more or less i think i got it.
So be me guest and change the code ( and teach me please) a little bit more of python and scrapy. Regards !
